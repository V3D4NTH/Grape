## Make It Your Own
To use Grape, your system must have [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) installed. 

-  Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/V3D4NTH/Grape
```

- Switch to the directory:
```sh
cd Grape
```


- Ensure you have `cargo (1.62)` installed locally
 
 - Run `./your_program.sh` to run your program, which is implemented in
   `src/main.rs`. This command compiles your Rust project, so it might be slow
   the first time you run it. Subsequent runs will be fast.

 - Build the project using:
```sh
cargo build --release
```
